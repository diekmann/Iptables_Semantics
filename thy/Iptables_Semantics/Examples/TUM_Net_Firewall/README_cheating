Q: What are those "_cheating" files?
A: As the name suggests, we manually modified the rulesets to yield better results. Whenever we load a _cheating file, we include the diff to the unmodified ruleset.

For example, we removed one rule at the beginning. Here is the diff to to unmodified ruleset:

diff -u iptables_20.11.2013 iptables_20.11.2013_cheating

The rule was simply dead.

We suffix everything which is based on this modified ruleset (with those three rules removed) '_cheating'.
In earlier versions, we also remove the ESTABLISHED;RELATED rule. Details why this is (was) reasonable can be found in the paper:

What it does _NOT_ mean:
 * Proofs not checked by isabelle
 * contrived example
 * modified data to underline a statement
 * made-up data
 * some undocumented modifications to the data
